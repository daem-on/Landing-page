<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Background images with Unsplash</h3>

[Unsplash](http://unsplash.com) is a free website where you can get CC0 images for any use.  They've made a service  
called [Unsplash Source](http://source.unsplash.com) that enables you to get random images from Unsplash just with the URL.  
Using this template, you can just give it the important bit of the URL, and it handles  
the resizing and everything else.

<h3>Easy configuration</h3>

The template doesn't need to be configured, but allows for a lot of customization. Change  
the font, size color and more of everything just by changing variables. You can import  
fonts from Google Fonts just by specifying the family name.

<h3>Customizable layout</h3>

You can change the layout to use the built-in features, or add your own features  
by only having to use Constuct 2 code.

<h3>Buttons</h3>

You don't have to write any CSS, you can just use the built-in variables,  
even seperately for each instance.

<h3>Lightweight</h3>

The whole project is about 15 events and 6 objects, so it's incredibly  
small in size. It also doesn't contain the background image, which  
makes it even smaller.
